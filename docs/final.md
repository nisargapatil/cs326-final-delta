## WeVote App

### Fall 2021

Our application is deployed on heroku on this link: https://wevote326.herokuapp.com


	We have implemented a web application where people can add and read product reviews in different categories. These reviews will be in the form of upvotes and downvotes on items in each category. Some of the categories that we have integrated into the application are: Entertainment, Food, and Travel. This application will be similar to some shopping websites in a way that the users have the ability to click on the item that they are interested in, and be directed to a different page where they can see more details about the particular item. These details will include the description of the item, and the number of upvotes/downvotes it gets. 

 	Our app is using the key concept from social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, where users are able to like/dislike each other’s posts and the person who’s posting can see the feedback they are receiving from other users. Since this is a familiar concept that many people do on a daily basis, the voting application will be very straightforward and intuitive to use.

	WeVote App will be helpful for the users who are looking for new places to travel, want to explore different food options, need TV show/movie recommendations, and so on. They can look at the upvotes and downvotes for all the items in different categories when they are trying to choose their best option. They can also upload any item of their choice into one of the categories so they can seek other users' opinions about that item in terms of upvotes and downvotes.

# Product Pages

When you click on 'view' on one of the featured products, it takes you to the product details page which displays the upvotes and downvotes on the product, and its description added by the user. 

For example, if you wanted to view more details about 'Stranger Things' on the 'Entertainment' page, this is what you will find :
