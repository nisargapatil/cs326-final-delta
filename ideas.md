# Innovation Idea
Our project idea is to implement a survey application where people can comment, react, and vote on items in different categories. Some of the categories that we want to integrate into the application are: beauty, entertainment, food, and travel. For example, if someone posted a beauty product such as X, people can react to it such as clicking a thumbs up button or thumbs down button. Users will only be a certain time span to react to the product until voting closes. Once there are multiple products on the website rated, it will be filtered from most positive ratings to most negative ratings. This allows the user to research and make better choices in their purchases.
